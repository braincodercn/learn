Winter 18-19
------------
* videotaped holiday lecture, but would probably have been too long in person
* dense pointer stuff, maybe rethink this and next lecture since they cover similar material.  What do they need to know before this HW?

Spring 18-19
-----------
* Don't talk about char str[] = "Hello".  Only introduce char * = "hello" for string literals.
* didn't have time to get to double pointers at all
* lots of questions about pointer stuff.  Maybe find a more gradual way to get into the pointers and memory topics.  E.g.
       - students wondering about memory addresses and confusion with the _bits_ that differ between addressess vs. the addresses as numbers
       - students haven't probably seen dereference or address-of operators before
* try to put more string-usage stuff in the previous lecture.  For instance, string arrays and memory errors.
