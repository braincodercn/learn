Winter 18-19
------------
* students associated char * with string constants and char[] with non-constant.  Need to better differentiate.

Spring 18-19
------------
* Liked the approach of avoiding char *s = "literal" until Monday when talking more about memory, but downside is it's hard to strip out uses of that (e.g. passing a string literal to strlen).  But definitely avoids initial confusion until students know more about memory.
* timing ok, with 5 min break
* lots of questions about "what ifs", maybe punt more for later discussions
