Winter 18-19
------------
* A little shaky - make sure to more clearly explain flag combinations for a < b (or remove?)
* didn't have time to complete stack section, or discussion of %rip
* spend less time recapping?

Spring 18-19
------------
* Still tough to bridge the gap between setting individual condition codes and having e.g. conditional jump "less than".  THe jump to combining condition codes to check state is tough.
* chunk of time spent on static vs. dynamic instruction counts.  shorten?  esp. since we show a version of loops that isn't used
* didn't get to do one larger reverse engineering problem
* just had enough time to get through
* example of set and cmov?
* example of for loops?
* example of if/else?
