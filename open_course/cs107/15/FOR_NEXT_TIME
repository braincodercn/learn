Winter 18-19
------------
* shaky getting through everything - only covered through implicit
* sync up more with assignment requirements, e.g. header size, alignment, etc.
* cover through implicit today, explicit and optimization in next one?
* hook more closely into assignment - restructure to be more like lecture 16
* maybe mention what client sees for header vs. payload

Spring 18-19
------------
* aggressive pacing (but not too fast, students were ok) getting through explicit.  Maybe slow down a bit?
* reformed based on lecture 16, hooked more closely into assignment
* mentioned what client sees for header vs. payload
* optimization next time.
* more interactivity?
