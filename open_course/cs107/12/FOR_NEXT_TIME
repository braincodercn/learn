Winter 18-19
------------
* Recorded video - can rewatch on YouTube
* a little dense - maybe save more for next lecture, or bump some of it to previous lecture? (e.g. mov and data size)
* change ending reverse engineering to remove/modify ambiguous if/else
* in ending reverse engineer example, deciding which is if vs which is else is tricky

Spring 18-19
-----------
* Shortenend, ended at CompilerExplorer example and did not start condition codes (probably a good pace)
* remember that movl auto-zeroing means no movlq
* is there an unsigned zero-extend for division?
* liked having students with reference sheets handy during lecture
* pull up division reference during live-walkthrough
* add lea examples using different destinations to show that destinations work the same way as mov
