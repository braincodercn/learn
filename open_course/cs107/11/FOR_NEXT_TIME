Winter 18-19
-------------
* didn't have time to get to move instruction byte sizes or beyond
* clarify slide with table that one side is stack and the other side is registers
* clarify that the addressing mode appears as either source or destination in mov
* give example mov instruction instead of just focusing on addressing mode
* potentially have people write single assembly instructions for C statements using mov?

Spring 18-19
------------
* Went much better!  Breaking up explanation of mov worked to get people understanding examples better
* still didn't have time to get to mov byte sizes
* should update register names to only use 64-bit registers (some people asked about 32 bit ones and what they are)
