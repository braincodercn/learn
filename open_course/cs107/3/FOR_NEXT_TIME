Winter 18-19
------------
* Didn't have time to do a shift example
* need to show larger example of how bit operations can fit together

Spring 18-19
------------
* Still too long - had to cut just to get through shifting
* need to push more about truncation/comparison to previous lecture
* need to be able to squeeze in absolute value for shifting example
* lots of questions about comparisons, some a little extra
* add animations for bitvector operators to let students think about it
