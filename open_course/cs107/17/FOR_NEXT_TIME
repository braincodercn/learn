Winter 18-19
------------
* Ended ~20min early
* great FAQ setup with pollev, students posting during break
* maybe a little long on sections about relevance of material and tooling and recap
* other cool things to show?  maybe hook more directly into 110?  or show more demos?
* encourage students to stop by anytime! [DONE]

Spring 18-19
------------
* MORE COOL DEMOS (too much talking/telling, needs more showing - like WebAssembly demo!)
* ended on time - good questions about classes to take, about intimidation in CS, etc.
* used PollEV but with moderation for posts to filter out stuff if needed
